1.DONE new expr file format, numeric matrix, first row is header, first column is sample ID.

2.DONE changed mind.
   by taking trees from each sample, a much larger diversity of trees is possible.
   then this forest can be filtered and sorted, taking the 'best' trees (high abs value).

3.DONE ...so .... need to complete the tree filtering and output function.

4. DONE... then can model each potential tree, and rank the results...

5. DONE ... added example random forest predictor with cross validation.

6. DONE ... print out final result and comparison to simulated set  used Jaccard Index

   ??? Will the top ranked gene set match the ground truth ???

      YES!!!
