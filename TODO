TODO

1. new expr file format, numeric matrix, first row is header, first column is sample ID.

2. changed mind.
   by taking trees from each sample, a much larger diversity of trees is possible.
   then this forest can be filtered and sorted, taking the 'best' trees (high abs value).

3. ...so .... need to complete the tree filtering and output function.

4. then can model each potential tree, and rank the results...

5. looking at pymc3... bayesian logistic mixed effect modeling???? see test in model.py



**************************

2. ready to fix the denovo group gene sets.

    - provide pheno vector
    - and file pointing to MSRs
    - going to need all MSRs in memory
        - for each level,
            - for each group
                - run watershed segmentation
                - do T-test between connected nodes.

     This is going to produce a component labeling per group, and per level.

     Then build MSR-trees across levels, connecting the components within groups. Can filter here.

     Write out the resulting trees.

     Use trees as features for GROUP LASSO ... will pick out denovo gene sets that best predict the groups.

     OR use mixed effect regression, per tree, and rank the resulting models.
