1. new expr file format, numeric matrix, first row is header, first column is sample ID.

2. ready to fix the denovo group gene sets.

    - provide pheno vector
    - and file pointing to MSRs
    - going to need all MSRs in memory
        - for each level,
            - for each group
                - run watershed segmentation
                - do T-test between connected nodes.

     This is going to produce a component labeling per group, and per level.

     Then build MSR-trees across levels, connecting the components within groups. Can filter here.

     Write out the resulting trees.

     Use trees as features for GROUP LASSO ... will pick out denovo gene sets that best predict the groups.

     OR use mixed effect regression, per tree, and rank the resulting models.
