TODO

1. DONE new expr file format, numeric matrix, first row is header, first column is sample ID.

2. DONE changed mind.
   by taking trees from each sample, a much larger diversity of trees is possible.
   then this forest can be filtered and sorted, taking the 'best' trees (high abs value).

3. DONE ...so .... need to complete the tree filtering and output function.

4. DONE... then can model each potential tree, and rank the results...

5. DONE ... added example random forest predictor with cross validation.

6. DONE ... print out final result and comparison to simulated set  used Jaccard Index

6.1  Read data once... pass it around.. setScoring randomForest, what else?

7.  Add MULTI-SCALE to the set scoring function.

19. When scoring, include genes in the set of interest?

8.  Add ssGSEA code to produce a ssGSEA score matrix (added, not called)

9.  RF model doesn't use MULTI-SCALE values yet.

10. DONE ... Add standard gene set scoring.

14. DONE ... need standard simulation.

11. Build GO set network, Cancer set network. Allow selection at run.

12. Enumerating sub-graphs crashes sometimes... what's wrong?

13. Write filter files to a directory

15. needs a set matrix for C7 (and others).

16. Function with minimal output to compare parameter settings.

17. Need to catalog all parameters and get them into the cmd line.

18. Move segmentation to parallel function.  How to speedup?

20. SIMULATION WITH MIXED SETS!!  Maybe derive sets the usual way,
    but then add a set-remix ... add a few more random links in the network,
    and splice sets where the new links form.

XX. For final analysis:  What is jaccard index (with error?) for different parameters?
                         What is predictive power (with MSR and without)?
                         What is separability by set scores?
                         Compare to ssGSEA for separability... depending on effect size.
                         Compare with respect to set sizes and overlap.
